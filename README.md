This is a prototype for a luthier instrument previewing app. The idea is that the client select 
a variety of instrument characteristics, making a full preview in the end, with colors, models, gear 
etc, and save them on its accounts. The app generates a price value, depending on the instrument 
features, than, the luthier can access all instruments made by the clients in a special 
manager account.
